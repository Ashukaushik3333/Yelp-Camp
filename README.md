# Web App: Yelp-Camp-Udemy
YelpCamp is a Node.js web application with RESTful routing project from the Udemy course - [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/)

  ## From the creater
  >This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  
  >This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging.
